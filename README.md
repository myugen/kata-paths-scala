# Functional Programming Kata : Paths

The objective of this Kata is to be a gentle introduction to Functional Programming in 1h30 - 2h.
Take 15 min to introduce the context, set up the groups and prepare the IDEs and 15 min at the end to share the code and
retrospect.

See the [slides](https://tyrcho.github.io/path-kata) for an introduction to the kata.

Edit the slides with [prose.io](http://prose.io/#tyrcho/path-kata/edit/master/docs/index.html)
